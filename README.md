## Development Details

This project demonstrates the implementation of a modern e-commerce platform using a **Node.js** backend with **Express.js** for routing and API management. The **React** frontend interacts with the backend to allow users to view products, manage their baskets, place orders, and manage their accounts. **MongoDB** is used to store all product, user, and order data.

## Getting Started

**Note**: This project requires **MongoDB** to be set up locally or remotely, and the proper connection strings should be configured.

### Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/kvintyuk1/Exam_React_Node.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the backend folder and run the server**:
    ```bash
    cd Exam_React_Node/online-store-backend && nodemon server.js
    ```

3. **Navigate to the frontend folder and start the React app**:
    ```bash
    cd Exam_React_Node/online-store-frontend && npm start
    ```

---

This will start both the backend and frontend of the application. Ensure that MongoDB is properly configured to ensure smooth functionality.
